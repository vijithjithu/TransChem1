The TransChem model is developed by combining the contextual features generated by transformer encoder and the hand crafted cheminformatics features. The model performance is evaluated over ten different datasets. The performance of TransChem model is compared with Gaussian Process Regression and TransPolymer models.
All datasets used in this study are stored in the `data` directory. For each property, three versions of the dataset are provided:

- `*_TransPolymer` – the original dataset  
- `*_chem_initial` – initial features generated using the RDKit library  
- `*_RFE` – the refined feature set obtained through Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which serves as input to the TransChem model


Nine out of 10 datasets are curated from the publication "TransPolymer: a Transformer-based language model for polymer property predictions"  by Xu et al. and the Atmoization energy dataset is taken from the Polymer genome. The folder "data" contains all the input data for GPR, TransPolymer and TransChem models. The folders with "_opt" contain the TransChem architecture and corresponding  hyperparameters, which are stored in config_rfe files. The "commonfiles" folder has the libraries for polymer tokenization and data processing.
