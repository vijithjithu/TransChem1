# TransChem

The TransChem model is developed by combining the contextual features generated by transformer encoder and the hand crafted cheminformatics features. The model performance is evaluated over ten different datasets. The performance of TransChem model is compared with Gaussian Process Regression and TransPolymer models.
For each property three data files are stored 1) "_TransPolymer" which is the original data 2)"_Each property has The data files used for each model can be found inside the data folder

Nine out of 10 datasets are curated from the publication "TransPolymer: a Transformer-based language model for polymer property predictions"  by Xu et al. and the Atmoization energy dataset is taken from the Polymer genome. The folder "data" contains all the input data for GPR, TransPolymer and TransChem models. The folders with "_opt" contain the TransChem architecture and corresponding  hyperparameters, which are stored in config_rfe files. The "commonfiles" folder has the libraries for polymer tokenization and data processing.
