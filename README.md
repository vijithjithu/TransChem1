The TransChem model is developed by combining the contextual features generated by transformer encoder and the hand crafted cheminformatics features. The model performance is evaluated over ten different datasets and compared with Gaussian Process Regression and TransPolymer models.
All datasets used in this study are stored in the "Data" directory. For each property, three versions of the dataset are provided:

- `*_TransPolymer` – the original dataset  
- `*_chem_initial` – initial features generated using the RDKit library  
- `*_RFE` – the refined feature set obtained through Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which serves as input to the TransChem model

The "Models" directory contains individual subdirectories for each property being modeled. Each subdirectory includes a .yaml file (prefixed with "config") that specifies the hyperparameters and data locations used for the TransChem model. Additionally, a .json file lists the selected features after performing Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). The TransChem code file is also included in each property-specific directory, containing the implementation details for the model.
The third main directory is "common_files" which has the essential libraries for polymer SMILES tokenization.
